/**
 * A utility for detecting swipe events on a specified HTML element.
 *
 * This utility provides a simple API to detect swipe gestures (left, right, up, down)
 * on any HTML element. It allows you to set callbacks for each swipe direction and manage
 * event listeners dynamically (adding/removing) based on the interaction requirements.
 *
 * ### Features:
 * - Supports four swipe directions: left, right, up, and down.
 * - Adjustable swipe sensitivity.
 * - Add and remove event listeners dynamically.
 *
 * ### Usage:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import { createSwipeDetector } from "swipe-detect-js";
 *
 * const swipeobject = document.querySelector('.swipe-object');
 * const detector = createSwipeDetector(swipeobject, { sensitivity: 100 }); // Sensitivity is optional
 *
 * detector.swipeLeft(() => {
 *   console.log('Swiped left');
 * });
 *
 * detector.swipeRight(() => {
 *   console.log('Swiped right');
 * });
 *
 * // You can also remove event listeners if needed:
 * detector.removeEventListeners();
 *
 * // And re-add them later:
 * detector.addEventListeners();
 * ```
 *
 * ### Parameters:
 *
 * - `element`: The target HTML element where swipe gestures will be detected.
 * - `sensitivity` (optional): The minimum distance (in pixels) required to trigger a swipe gesture.
 *    Default value is 50.
 *
 * ### Methods:
 *
 * - `swipeLeft(callback: () => void): void`
 *   - Registers a callback function to be called when a left swipe is detected.
 *
 * - `swipeRight(callback: () => void): void`
 *   - Registers a callback function to be called when a right swipe is detected.
 *
 * - `swipeUp(callback: () => void): void`
 *   - Registers a callback function to be called when an upward swipe is detected.
 *
 * - `swipeDown(callback: () => void): void`
 *   - Registers a callback function to be called when a downward swipe is detected.
 *
 * - `removeEventListeners(): void`
 *   - Removes all attached event listeners from the target element. This is useful if
 *     you want to disable swipe detection temporarily or completely.
 *
 * - `addEventListeners(): void`
 *   - Re-attaches event listeners to the target element. Use this method after calling
 *     `removeEventListeners()` to resume swipe detection.
 *
 * ### Example:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * const swipeDetector = createSwipeDetector(document.body, { sensitivity: 80 });
 *
 * swipeDetector.swipeLeft(() => {
 *   console.log('Detected swipe left');
 * });
 *
 * swipeDetector.swipeRight(() => {
 *   console.log('Detected swipe right');
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Notes:
 * - The swipe detection is based on touch events (`touchstart`, `touchmove`, and `touchend`), making it
 *   ideal for mobile devices and touch-screen interfaces. It won't work on non-touch devices unless
 *   additional mouse handling is implemented.
 *
 * - The sensitivity parameter controls how much movement is needed to trigger a swipe event.
 *   A higher value makes swipes harder to trigger (requires more movement).
 *
 * - Use the `removeEventListeners()` method when you want to stop listening for swipe gestures,
 *   which can improve performance in certain scenarios.
 *
 * @param element - The HTML element to detect swipe events on.
 * @param sensitivity - (Optional) The sensitivity level for swipe detection, default is 50 pixels.
 * @returns SwipeDetector - An object containing methods to register swipe callbacks and manage event listeners.
